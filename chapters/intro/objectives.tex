We introduce a technique for compositional checking of reachability in Petri
nets. We show that by suitably exploiting a \emph{compositional specification}
of nets our technique can be more efficient than existing approaches. In this
thesis, the introduction of our new technique is sub-divided into:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Investigation of compositional approaches to statespace generation and
    thus reachability checking of Petri nets, exploiting compositional
    specifications in order to avoid the statespace explosion and improve
    performance.
\item The application of programming language techniques to design a statically
    typed specification language for concise, well-defined compositional
    specifications.
\item Implementation of a tool for checking Petri net reachability using the
    techniques, with demonstrable performance increases vs existing
    state-of-the-art tools.
\end{enumerate}
