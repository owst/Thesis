We survey and summarise the most-closely related techniques for avoiding
statespace explosion, in particular when checking reachability in Petri nets,
directing the reader to detailed surveys and discussions where they exist.

Before we do so, we briefly introduce each technique and give the structure of
this chapter: in~\secref{sec:reachabilityChecking}, we briefly discuss Petri
nets and the
complexity of their reachability checking.
In~\secref{sec:partialOrderApproaches}, we discuss \emph{partial-order
approaches}, which attempt to generate only part of the statespace, while
ensuring that the to-be-checked properties are preserved. In a similar vein,
the \emph{symmetry reduction}~\secref{sec:symmetryReduction} technique attempts
to generate a reduced statespace, by recognising symmetric states, which do not
contribute new (up to symmetry) states to explore, i.e.  the statespace is
quotiented by symmetry. We then move onto discussing other compositional (i.e.
divide and conquer) approaches in~\secref{sec:compositionalApproaches}, before
taking a detour from statespace minimisation techniques to discuss
\emph{algebras} of nets related to that which we use in this thesis. We briefly
discuss explicit structural reductions of nets that aim to reduce input nets
in~\secref{sec:structuralReductions}. In~\secref{sec:unfoldings}, we explore
the use of \emph{unfoldings} as a compact representation of a net's behaviour,
and similarly the use of \emph{decision diagrams} as a compact representation
of a net's structure~\secref{sec:decisionDiagrams}.  Finally, we explore
\emph{linear programming} (LP) and \emph{SAT solving} in~\secref{sec:LPAndSAT},
which encode Petri net problems into alternate domains possessing efficient
algorithms.

The techniques to avoid statespace explosion that we explore can be
summarised as taking one of the following approaches:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generating partial statespaces (partial order reductions, symmetry
        reduction)
    \item Handling a reduced input net (structural net reductions)
    \item Using compact representations of the net (unfoldings, decision
        diagrams)
    \item Translating to an alternative domain to exploit existing algorithms
        (SAT, LP)
\end{enumerate}
